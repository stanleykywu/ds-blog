But being the rebellious compsci major I am who has tried to escape all things english related (and failed miserably), I’m going to do something completely cliché to begin my first blog post and write a traditional introduction (thank you english teachers for the many years of practice). This is about a project that a group of friends and I did for our first “real” artificial intelligence class of college. To the fellow NEU students out there, the class is CS4100 and if he’s still teaching, I highly recommend Professor Kevin Gold.</summary></entry></feed>
