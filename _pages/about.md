While I was writing this, I thought it might be more fun to have reading this be like having a conversation with me in real life. That way, it's more fun for me to write and hopefully more fun for you to read! I love badminton, been playing since I was a kid (subtle flex but I was once top 20 in the Under 17 Category for Singles in the USA!). I also played the violin in high school, where I got very interested in classical music. Nothing beats playing with an orchestras at Symphony Hall! Recently, I've realized just how fun and amazing hiking is. Below is a picture of me at Mount Monadnock!
